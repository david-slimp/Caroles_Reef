## 🌊 The Full Vision

When fully developed, Carole’s Reef will feature:

* A **large, fully navigable 3D reef tank** you can explore from any angle.
* **Many species of fish and marine life**, each with unique traits, personalities, and genetic variations.
* **Breeding and genetics**: raise fish, see their offspring inherit traits, and discover rare combinations.
* **Interactive ornaments** like corals, sea plants, structures, and even a small whirlpool for removing unwanted items.
* **Occasional uplifting messages** from fish, ranging from happy thoughts to short, encouraging or philosophical lines.
* **Customizable environment** with decorations you can arrange anywhere in the tank.
* An emphasis on **calm, enjoyable observation** over fast-paced or competitive gameplay.

## 🐠 Current Development Stage

We’re still in the very early stages of building Carole’s Reef.
Right now, the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** focus is on:

* Creating a small test tank in 3D space.
* Adding a few fish to swim in the environment (currently simple placeholder shapes).
* Adding basic corals or ornaments.
* Smooth camera controls so players can look around the tank.
* A simple button to add more fish.

This early version is mostly about getting the **core space and camera working** before adding the deeper gameplay systems.
