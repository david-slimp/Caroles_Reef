Egg: (still attached/in mother) - The beginning, where the fish embryo develops within the fertilized egg.
Larvae: (just "born", in sac, not moving) - Newly hatched fish, still relying on their yolk sac for nourishment.
Fry: (tiny fish; start moving) -  After the yolk sac is absorbed, they are free-swimming and can forage independently.
Juvenile: (not able to breed yet) -  This is a transitional stage as the fish grows from fry to a reproductively mature adult, according to Sea Grant Michigan. They might also be called a parr at this stage, depending on the species.
Adult: (most life at this age) -  The stage where the fish is reproductively mature and can spawn.
Mature: ( getting a bit older )
Elderly: (final stages of normal lifespan) -  The final stage, where the fish ages and its growth rate slows considerably.
Ancient: (past normal lifespan; FAVORITE turned on keeping it alive)
